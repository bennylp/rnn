Resources to learn Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

## Tutorials

* A good intro to RNN from WildML:
  * [Part 1: Recurrent Neural Networks Tutorial, Part 1 â€“ Introduction to RNNs](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-1-introduction-to-rnns/)
  * [Part 2: Implementing a RNN using Python and Theano](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-2-implementing-a-language-model-rnn-with-python-numpy-and-theano/)
  * [Part 3: Understanding the Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) algorithm and the vanishing gradient problem](http://www.wildml.com/2015/10/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-3-backpropagation-through-time-and-vanishing-gradients/)
    * Also checkout the detailed derivation of BPTT [here (PDF)](https://github.com/go2carter/nn-learn/blob/master/grad-deriv-tex/rnn-grad-deriv.pdf)
  * [Part 4: Implementing a GRU/LSTM RNN](http://www.wildml.com/2015/10/recurrent-neural-network-tutorial-part-4-implementing-a-grulstm-rnn-with-python-and-theano/)
* Very good intro to LSTMs:
  * [Understanding LSTM Networks](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)
